- Wallet / Delete exit trade
    - fix toLowerCase issue (front to back end) **

- EntryTradeLogPage
    - Make it so that deleting an entry also deletes the exit trade if it's already sold. Return balances back to normal
    - may be case where trading funds are not enough (transfer back funds to tradingWallet to delete trade)

- NewEntryTradePage
    - Build simple error modal (trade still goes thru when currency and coin are not selected)

    - Issues:
        - 

- Add 0, 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 buttons to 'max' section (wallet, newEntryTradePage)
- Fix deleteTrade() in DeleteTradeModal - sometimes wallet balances are not updated correctly. Not sure why
- NewEntryTradePage - required for both selects (don't let user submit until all fields are filled)
- Rename 'currency' and 'coinName' fields in trade models to baseCurrency and quoteCurrency
- Fix decimals toFixed on trades / balances
- Change 'funds' field to 'balance' (front / back end)
- Use correct decimal placement for different alts (currencies.js)
- Add *Nomics API to get real time market data, and integrate into app to dynamically render using API data
