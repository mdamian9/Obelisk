- To-do next:

- EntryTradeLogPage
    - Make it so that deleting an entry also deletes the exit trade if it's already sold. Return balances back to normal
        - Fix deleteTrade() in DeleteTradeModal - sometimes wallet balances are not updated correctly. Not sure why
    - may be case where trading funds are not enough (transfer back funds to tradingWallet to delete trade)

- EntryTradeRow
    - Double check if switch statement returns correct output
    
- Tutorial Page
    - Begin building tutorial page

- Resources Page
    - Finish resources page

- Make App responsive / optimzied for mobile browsers
    - Issues:
        - 

- toLowerCase issue (fix from root - user model - wallets)
- Props - user - getting user data and passing as prop <> getting user data again (fix)
- Rename 'currency' and 'coinName' fields in trade models to baseCurrency and quoteCurrency
- Fix decimals toFixed on trades / balances
- Change 'funds' field to 'balance' (front / back end)
- Use correct decimal placement for different alts (currencies.js)
- Add *Nomics API to get real time market data, and integrate into app to dynamically render using API data

- In the end, convert all possible class components to functional components using useState
- Review and comment code

* Questions *

- Unneccessary event.target.resets when showing alerts? (All through out components)
- 304 status code (GET /user/:id)
- Using AuthService in multiple components to get user id, vs just setting user id in withAuth when setting profile
